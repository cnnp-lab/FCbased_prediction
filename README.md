# FCbased_prediction
Preprocessed data and code for the manuscript on FC-based prediction of stimulation responses
see publication here: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/ac5568/meta

Use the script run_step_by_step.m to run through all the preprocessing and analysis steps.
The script is split into sections so that you can run and reproduce only a subset of the results, if prefered (use the 'Run Section' tool in Matlab).
However, the preprocessing needs to be executed before any top level analysis.

IMPORTANT: Download the following mat file and place it alongside dataPerSession_sorted.mat:
