# FCbased_prediction
Preprocessed data and code for the manuscript on FC-based prediction of stimulation responses
see publication here: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/ac5568/meta

Use the script run_step_by_step.m to run through all the preprocessing and analysis steps.
The script is split into sections so that you can run and reproduce only a subset of the results, if prefered (use the 'Run Section' tool in Matlab).
However, the preprocessing needs to be executed before any top level analysis.

Minor changes still pending for better labeling and commenting.
