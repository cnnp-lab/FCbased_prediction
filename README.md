# FCbased_prediction
Preprocessed data and code for the manuscript on FC-based prediction of stimulation responses.
Relevant publication in the Journal of Neural Engineering: https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-2552/ac5568

Use the script run_step_by_step.m to run through all the preprocessing and analysis steps.
The script is split into sections so that you can run and reproduce sequentially the results, step by step (use the 'Run Section' tool in Matlab).
You can skip preceding steps in the analysis, e.g. for Figure 2 results, and go directly to later analysis sections, e.g. for Fig 5.
However, the preprocessing needs to be executed before any top level analysis.
